# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest version is up-to-date with security fixes. You can update by running ``git pull`` in the directory where you installed this.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities in the security tab. DO NOT report vulnerabilities in the issues tab, as that will allow anyone to see and exploit them.
